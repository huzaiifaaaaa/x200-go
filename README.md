# X200 GO Dataset Reverse Engineering  
**Hack the Dataset from X200 GO – 3D Modelling Sensor**

## Overview
This repository contains the code, experiments, and documentation developed as part of a research-oriented software project focused on **reverse engineering undocumented binary data formats** produced by the **Stonex X200 GO SLAM 3D mapping sensor**.

The X200 GO records data from multiple sensors (IMU, GNSS, LiDAR, camera) into proprietary binary files that are normally accessible only through vendor software (*Slam Go Post*).  
This project explores **vendor-independent access** to those data formats using systematic reverse engineering techniques.

> ⚠️ This is an **exploratory research project**.

---

## Project Goals
- Analyze undocumented binary files generated by the X200 GO sensor  
- Identify file structure, headers, and frame boundaries  
- Experiment with decoding strategies for different sensor modalities  
- Partially decode and validate **GNSS / navigation data**  
- Document methods, failures, and limitations to support future work  

**Primary objective:** Data decoding and format understanding  
**Secondary objective:** User interface (not realized)

## Key Approaches Used

### Binary Inspection
- Hex-level inspection to identify headers, ASCII strings, and repeating patterns  
- Detection of a **1024-byte header** and structured payload regions  

### Frame-Based Testing
- Hypothesized fixed-size records (e.g., 33-byte IMU frames)  
- Brute-force decoding using:
  - Multiple data types (`int16`, `uint16`, `int32`, `uint32`, `float32`)
  - Little-endian and big-endian formats
  - All valid byte offsets  
- Visualization used to reject implausible interpretations  

### GNSS & NMEA Pattern Recognition
- Identification of embedded **NMEA sentences**:
  - `$GNGGA`
  - `$GNRMC`
- GNSS messages extracted, decoded, and plotted  
- Consistent update rates and structured navigation frames observed  
- Absolute timestamps and coordinates were **not directly interpretable**, indicating undocumented encoding or transformations  

### Visualization-Based Validation
- Extensive plotting of decoded values to assess:
  - Continuity
  - Sampling behavior
  - Physical plausibility  
- Helped eliminate incorrect hypotheses early  

### Reverse Engineering Tools
- Manual parsing and decoding in Python  
- Evaluation of tools such as **Binwalk** (not usable programmatically in this environment)  
- Literature review of automated format inference approaches

## Major Findings
- Proprietary binary files have **consistent and repeatable structure**  
- GNSS/navigation data can be partially decoded **without vendor software**  
- Files follow a **hybrid structure** (standard NMEA + proprietary binary payloads)  
- A previously unknown **white-label SLAM application** exists, confirming third-party decoding feasibility  
- Full decoding of IMU and LiDAR payloads remains unresolved  

---

## Technologies Used
- **Python 3**
- NumPy, `struct`, matplotlib  
- Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab  
- Hex editors for low-level inspection
- Tupni, Binwalk

---

## Future Work
- Resolve timestamp encoding and reference epochs  
- Identify coordinate systems and scaling factors  
- Extend decoding to IMU and LiDAR payloads  
- Implement a lightweight visualization or analysis interface  
- Formalize parsers once formats are fully understood
